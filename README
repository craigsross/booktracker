I enjoy reading, and building up series of books.
I was losing track of which books I had from each series.
I decided to build an application which would allow me
to keep track of which books and series I had.
Having learned procedural CFML through the good old
CFWACK (second hand), I wanted to learn OO coding
and also practice using frameworks.
The plan with this app is to develop apps which work the
same, off the same database, but using different coding
practices.
