I enjoy reading, and building up series of books.
I was losing track of which books I had from each series.
I decided to build an application which would allow me
to keep track of which books and series I had.
Having learned procedural CFML through the good old
CFWACK (second hand), I wanted to learn OO coding
and also practice using frameworks.
The plan with this app is to develop apps which work the
same, off the same database, but using different coding
practices.

plainoo branch is a version using object-oriented 
principles but no formal framework beyond what came out
of my head. The structure is based on Matt (Awesome
Producer) Gifford's Object-Oriented Programming in
ColdFusion book, published by PACKT

Uses Bob Silverberg's ValidateThis framework for
client and server side validation
